The data in the Powersets folder contains json versions of the data separated by powerset - this data was extracted from the Mids Hero Designer Database files.
All of the above is I24 beta content, originally acquired from the I24 client data files introduced with 'Power Numbers' update.
Without having power implementation data for Issue 1 data - we may need to work backwards from I24 powers to get them similar to Issue 1.
Or even come up with our own implementations / interpretations of powers based on the descriptions etc.


Questions:
Do we want to handle power effects on server side via scripting (Lua etc) - or are the powers going to be implemented in C++.
Implementing a c++ LUA API might be more maintainable - just my own two thoughts.
