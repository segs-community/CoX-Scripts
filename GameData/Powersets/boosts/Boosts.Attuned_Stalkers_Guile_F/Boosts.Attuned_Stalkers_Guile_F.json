  "Description": "UNIQUE -- No more than 1 enhancement of this type may be slotted by a character.  Gives the Stalker a chance to enter a hidden state when they strike their target with the slotted power and reduces recharge time by {Boost.Attrib.Recharge.Scale}%.  This effect will trigger roughly 4 times per minute.  This enhancement can only be slotted by Stalkers and can be slotted into nearly all Stalker damage powers.",
