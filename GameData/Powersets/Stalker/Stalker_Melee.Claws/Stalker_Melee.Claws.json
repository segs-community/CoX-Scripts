  "Description": "Claws are bones or blades that extend from your hands and cause Lethal damage. The lightweight, natural feel of claws gives this power set a reduced Endurance cost and faster attack rate than other Stalker melee sets.  Like all Stalker primary attack powers, Claw attacks can land a Critical Hit for double damage, if you are properly Hidden or if your target is Slept or Held.",
